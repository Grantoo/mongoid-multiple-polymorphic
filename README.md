mongoid-multiple-polymorphic
============================

Support backward compatibility for multiple polymorphic relationships for mongoid 4

In mongoid 4, a model can no longer have more than 1 field with the same polymorphic class. This brings back the functionality to allow a smooth transition from mongoid 3 to mongoid 4.
